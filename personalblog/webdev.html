                <h1>My Web Development Journey</h1>
                <img src="web.jpg" alt="Web Development" class="blog-image">
                <p>Ever since middle school, I’ve been fascinated by computers and the world of technology. It all began with a curious spark, which soon grew into a passion for computer science. As I progressed through my higher secondary education, this interest evolved into a genuine love for coding.</p>
                <p>When I entered college, I was introduced to the intricate world of web development. I learned about how websites are built and the roles of both frontend and backend development. This newfound knowledge only fueled my excitement, especially because I have always loved designing things. From childhood, I enjoyed creating and personalizing everything around me, and this inherent love for design naturally aligned with web development.</p>
                <p>Over the years, I have expanded my skills to include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Recently, I have taken on learning React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This journey has not only been educational but also incredibly rewarding. I’ve actively participated in website design competitions and engaged in basic internships, applying what I’ve learned in real-world scenarios.</p>
                <p>This journey has been both challenging and exhilarating. Every project and competition has further solidified my passion for web development. It’s a field that continues to evolve, and there’s always something new to learn and explore.</p>
                <p>As I look back, I realize that the path to where I am now has been a blend of curiosity, learning, and hands-on experience. To anyone who might be hesitant or unsure about starting their own journey in web development or any other field, remember: It’s never too late to start. Embrace the learning process, stay curious, and dive in—your journey could lead you to places you never imagined.</p>

            <p>Our family embarked on a memorable 3-day, 4-night trip to Ooty, a beautiful hill station known for its stunning landscapes and pleasant climate. We traveled by car, enjoying the scenic drive through the hills and valleys, which was an adventure in itself.</p>
            <p>During our stay, we explored several famous places in Ooty. Our itinerary included a visit to the iconic Ooty Lake, where we enjoyed a serene boat ride. The experience of boating on the tranquil waters provided a perfect opportunity for us to bond as a family, creating cherished memories together.</p>
            <p>We also visited the Doddabetta Peak, the highest point in Ooty, offering panoramic views of the surrounding hills. The lush greenery and the cool breeze at the peak were truly refreshing. Another highlight of our trip was the Botanical Gardens, where we marveled at the vibrant array of flowers and plants.</p>
            <p>Our trip was not just about sightseeing; it also involved indulging in some local treats. We bought delicious handmade chocolates from the local shops, a sweet reminder of our visit. The trip was an enriching experience, combining adventure, relaxation, and quality family time.</p>
            <p>As we drove back home, we reflected on the wonderful moments we had shared. This trip to Ooty was more than just a getaway; it was a journey that strengthened our family bonds and left us with lasting memories. It was a reminder that exploring new places together is one of the greatest joys in life.</p>
